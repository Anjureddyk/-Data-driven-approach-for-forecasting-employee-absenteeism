# -Data-driven-approach-for-forecasting-employee-absenteeism
Creating a model for forecasting employee absenteeism which helps HR's to take an advantage of making intelligent decisions.

Employee absenteeism can have significant financial and operational impacts on a business, including reduced productivity, increased costs, and lowered morale. A data-driven approach for forecasting employee absenteeism can help businesses anticipate and mitigate these impacts by identifying patterns and trends in employee absence data. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical absence data, businesses can gain insights into factors that contribute to employee absenteeism and develop proactive strategies to reduce absenteeism in the future.

This project has developed a data-driven approach for forecasting employee absenteeism using machine learning algorithms. The project will involve collecting and cleaning historical absence data from a company's HR system, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, and using machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models. The models will be trained on historical data and evaluated on their ability to accurately predict employee absenteeism for a given time period.

The provided data in this project contains two datasets, where you can try on your own to clean it or preprocess it for further processing, so kept it uncleaned and the other dataset contains prepocessed data which is cleaned and processed.
